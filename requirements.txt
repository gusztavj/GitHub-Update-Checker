# T1nk-R's GitHub Update Checker // requirements.txt

# This module lists the Python packages this application needs.

# Module authored by T1nk-R (https://github.com/gusztavj/)
#
# PURPOSE & USAGE *****************************************************************************************************************
#
# This Flask-based web server application works as a middleware or proxy between a Python module/application and GitHub and can
# be used to perform checking for updates using your personal GitHub API key without disclosing it to the public and without
# flooding GitHub. For the latter, this proxy stores fresh release (version) information in its cache and serves requests from
# the cache until it expires or direct checking is forced.
#
# Help, support, updates and anything else: https://github.com/gusztavj/GitHub-Update-Checker/
